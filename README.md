# Project Proposal
### by May Hathaway, Sasha Wald, and Lei Lin


#### Project Description: (DRAFT)
We will be working on a server/client system which allows multiple clients to connect and chat with one another. The chat-room will support additional features, including username/password logins (i'm not sure if we're doing this but thought i'd add it for now b/c it seems like a good idea - sasha), a stored record of chat sessions between users, and multiplayer games which store a record of high-score results.

#### User Interface Description: 

#### Technical Design: 
- Use of topics covered in class
- Breakdown of work
- Use of data structures and/or algorithms
- Timeline
