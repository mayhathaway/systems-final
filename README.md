# Project Proposal
#### by May Hathaway, Sasha Wald, and Lei Lin


### Project Description: (DRAFT)
We will be working on a server/client system which allows multiple clients to connect and chat with one another. The chat-room will support additional features, including username/password logins (i'm not sure if we're doing this but thought i'd add it for now b/c it seems like a good idea - sasha), a stored record of chat sessions between users, and simple multiplayer games (tic tac toe & hangman could be good options - sasha) which store a record of high-scores.

### User Interface Description: 

### Technical Design: 
- #### Use of topics covered in class
  - Named pipes will be used to send information between chatters and the server 
  - We will work with files in order to create chat records (we could also use files for high scores? but i didn't add that just in case - sasha)
  - Signals (ctrl-c) from users will be processed in order to close chatlogs and remove unfinished games
  - Memory allocation will be used when creating structs that hold username/password information
